This repository contains code for estimating high-dimensional networks generated by saturated log-linear point process models.  We consider a variant of an AR(1) model:

</p>

Where g is a saturation function which forces stability of the process.  To estimate the matrix A we use regularized MLE with the following penalties:

* l_1 norm
* Nuclear norm
* Group lasso
* Nuclear norm plus l_1 norm

We also implement ARMA(1,1) model estimation with sparsity regularization.  

To solve the RMLE optimization problem we use the [SpaRSA algorithm](http://www.lx.it.pt/~mtf/SpaRSA/IEEE_TSP_2009_Wright_Nowak_Figueiredo.pdf).  The low-rank plus sparse model is optimized using alternating descent.

This code builds on code written by [Eric Hall](http://erichall87.github.io/) and is discussed in more detail in [this paper](https://arxiv.org/abs/1802.04838).
